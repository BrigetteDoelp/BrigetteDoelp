#### About The Developer
* I'm a recently graduated student of Turng School of Software and Design!
* My previous work was in sales, both in the car industry and the tabletop gaming industry.
* I want to make beautiful and useful things.
* Personally invested in making the traditionally male industries of tech and nerd more inclusive for the gals, gays, and theys!
* React is my favourite.
